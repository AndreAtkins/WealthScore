Did you know that wealth is not synonomous with income?
Many high income earning people never obtain generational wealth. 
This is because wealth principals are not practiced, but ignored 
and sometimes even socially frowned upon. Did you know that your credit score 
alone isnt enough to determine your wealth potential or even financial 
wellbeing? This is why we created WealthScore, an algorithm that uses 
your current financial situation, to determine how efficiently you're 
actively building wealth and even give insight on how to improve or maintain your score.
